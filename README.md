# Daily Mood Tracker & Journal
A clean and user-friendly web application built with **Flask** that allows users to log their daily mood and maintain a short journal entry. It also displays past entries to encourage reflection and mental well-being.\

## How It Works
The app presents a simple form where users can:
- Select their current mood from a dropdown
- Write a short journal entry describing their day
- View a chronological list of past entries below the form
Each journal entry is saved with a timestamp and displayed with the selected mood.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML, CSS (for frontend styling)
- (Optional) JSON or text files for data storage
